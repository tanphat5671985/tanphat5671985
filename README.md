## ABOUT ME
<br>
Welcome to my introduction! I'm Phat, a 22-year-old recent graduate with a degree in Information Technology from Ton Duc Thang University. Along my academic journey, I've gained extensive knowledge in Information Technology, with a specific focus on software testing.

<br />
<br>
My passion goes beyond merely understanding programming languages and staying abreast of emerging technologies; it extends to the practical application of this knowledge in devising effective testing solutions. Currently, I am actively advancing my proficiency in the field through dedicated studies in automation testing.

<br />
<br>
I am seeking a career opportunity in software testing where I can apply and develop my full potential. I am eager to meet and collaborate with passionate colleagues in a challenging environment where I can continuously learn and enhance my skills.

<br />
<br>
My commitment and strong work ethic will serve as a constant source of motivation, contributing added value to projects and the organization as a whole. I look forward to the opportunity to meet and further discuss how I can contribute to the success of your team or organization.
